### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle, a pretty generalist developer that has done a variety of fullstack work, game modding / developement, and task automation.

#### Favorite Personal Projects
1. [cookiecutter-robust-python](https://github.com/56kyle/cookiecutter-robust-python) - My attempt at making a worthy successor to [cookiecutter-hypermodern-python](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python) that is built for adapting to changes.
2. [pytest-static](https://github.com/56kyle/pytest-static) - My pride and ~joy~ suffering; A Pytest Plugin that allows parametrizing tests using types instead of instance sets.
3. [cookiecutter-hypermodern-python](https://github.com/56kyle/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python) - My personal fork of the [cookiecutter-hypermodern-python](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python) that I have improved upon a fair bit.
4. [pychess](https://github.com/56kyle/pychess) - A Chess program written as practice following principles outlined in the book "Clean Code"
5. [bloons_auto](https://github.com/56kyle/bloons_auto) - An API for playing btd6 (Bloons Tower Defense 6) with Python

#### Tools/Software I highly recommend
1. [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) - Adds Vim controls to your web browser. Even if you don't use Vim elsewhere it is super useful.
2. [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) - Selenium is already nice, but there is a browser IDE that they have which allows you to record actions and then export them to code in your language of choice.
3. [Json Resume](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/) - A schema for your resume that allows for building and exporting into various themes with minimal hassle.
