### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle, a pretty generalist developer that has done a variety of fullstack work, game modding / developement, and task automation.

#### Favorite Personal Projects
1. [bloons_auto](https://github.com/56kyle/bloons_auto) - An API for playing btd6 (Bloons Tower Defense 6) with Python
2. [pydm](https://github.com/56kyle/pydm) - (WIP) - A Python package for converting Byond's dm files into Python compatible objects
3. [goon_parser](https://github.com/56kyle/goon_parser) - The precursor to pydm; A python Package that allows converting static data inside Byond's dm files into json.

#### Tools/Software I highly recommend
1. [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) - Adds Vim controls to your web browser. Even if you don't use Vim elsewhere it is super useful.
2. [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) - Selenium is already nice, but there is a browser IDE that they have which allows you to record actions and then export them to code in your language of choice.
3. [Json Resume](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/) - A schema for your resume that allows for building and exporting into various themes with minimal hassle.
